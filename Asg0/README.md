This is my assignment 0 for my CSE160 class in which I extended the DrawRectangle example from the WebGL textbook.

I extended the matrix library provided by the textbook to support vector operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, cross product, dot product, etc. 

-Created objected oriented graphics project in Javascript.
-Drew to a <canvas> element using a 2D context.
-Reviewed fundamental concepts of Linear Algebra.

I really enjoyed doing this assignment and it worked as a really good refresher for JavaScript and HTML tbh.

I used the following elements in my project:
- https://www.cuemath.com/geometry/angle-between-vectors/ got a formula from here
- https://mathweb.ucsd.edu/~lni/math20e/l2.pdf got a formula from here
- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML for documentation on HTML 
- https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_input.asp for documentation on HTML
- used chatgpt and vertex ai when stuck on some steps, any line where I used it should be cited.
